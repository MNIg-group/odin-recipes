            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Toast the turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a
                    Dutch
                    oven or large
                    pot over medium-low heat until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir the spices constantly
                    as
                    they toast,
                    taking care that they do not burn. Stir in the olive oil, onion, garlic, and ginger. Increase heat
                    to
                    medium, and cook
                    until softened, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the tomato paste until no lumps of paste remain. Add the chicken, potatoes, tomatoes,
                    chicken
                    broth, wine
                    vinegar, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and
                    simmer
                    until the
                    potatoes are tender, and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. Remove the
                    cover, and cook 5
                    minutes more to thicken slightly. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to
                    serve.
